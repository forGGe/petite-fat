# Petit FAT File System Module

Created by ELM. Originally can be found at [elm-chan.org](http://elm-chan.org/fsw/ff/00index_p.html).

Petit FatFs is a sub-set of FatFs module for tiny 8-bit microcontrollers. 
It is written in compliance with ANSI C and completely separated from the disk I/O layer. 
It can be incorporated into the tiny microcontrollers with limited memory even if the RAM size is less than sector size. 
Also full featured FAT file system module is available [here](http://elm-chan.org/fsw/ff/00index_e.html)

This module slightly modified for purposes of [theCore Embedded Framework](https://github.com/forGGe/theCore)
